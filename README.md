# Spoopy Stack Ansible Playbook

This Ansible playbook is used to configure and deploy Spoopy services across different server groups. It includes roles for common server configuration, security hardening, and service-specific deployments. This automation allows us to bring up Spoopy Service from a bare Debian-based installation to serving traffic for pilots in around 2.5 minutes on x86 and ARM64 architectures.

## Prerequisites

- Ansible >= 2.9.0
- Python >= 3.8
- SSH access to target servers
- Sudo privileges on target servers

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd spoopy-stack
```

2. Install required Ansible collections and roles:
```bash
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

3. Install pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended):
```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Configuration

1. Configure your inventory in the `inventory/` directory.

2. For convenience save the vault password in `.vault_pass` file (Optional)

## Usage

### Running the Playbook

To run the playbook against all hosts:
```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml --vault-pass-file .vault_pass --ask-become-pass
```

### Using Vault

To edit sensitive variables:
```bash
ansible-vault edit ./inventory/group_vars/spoopy/vault.yml
```

## Playbook Structure

The playbook consists of the following main components:

- `site.yml`: Main playbook file
- `roles/`: Contains all Ansible roles
- `inventory/`: Server inventory configuration
- `requirements.yml`: External role and collection dependencies

### Host Groups

- `all`: Common configuration for all servers
- `spoopy`: Spoopy services deployment

## Roles

The playbook includes the following roles:

- `common`: Basic server configuration
- `geerlingguy.security`: Security hardening
- `geerlingguy.docker`: Docker installation and configuration
- `buyback`: Buyback service deployment
- `wanderer`: Wanderer service deployment
- `traefik`: Traefik reverse-proxy server configuration

## Development

### Code Quality

The project uses:
- `yamllint` for YAML linting
- `pre-commit` hooks for automated checks

### Testing

Before committing changes, ensure:
1. All YAML files are properly formatted
2. The playbook runs without errors
3. All sensitive data is properly encrypted
